Ministry(政府部门) demands(要求) extradition（引渡）order withdrawal, fair treatment(公平对待) for firms（公司，affirm 断言，证实，肯定）

Beijing strongly(强烈) protested(抗议) Washington's extradition request of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou and demanded(要求) "objective" treatment(客观对待) for Chinese enterprises(中国企业).

Foreign Ministry spokesman(外交部发言人) Geng Shuang said on Tuesday that China is dissatisfied with(不满) and firmly(坚决地) opposed to(反对) the United States' extradition demand and its disregarding(不理会) Beijing's stern representations(严肃表态).

"We call on(呼吁) the US side to immediately withdraw(撤销) the arrest warrant(依据) for Meng Wanzhou as well as the official extradition(引渡) request," Geng said at a daily news conference(会议).

He also urged(规劝) Canada to take China's position(立场) seriously, release（释放）Meng immediately and ensure（确保） that her lawful and legitimate(合法) rights(权利) and interests(利益) are protected. Ottawa should not risk endangering itself for other's gains(为他人作嫁衣), he added.

The US Justice Department unsealed criminal charges Monday against Huawei and its several subsidiaries(子公司), as well as Meng herself, alleging(断言) the company stole trade secrets（商业机密）, misled banks about its business and violated(违反) US sanctions（批准）. Canada's Justice Department confirmed later that officials had received a formal extradition request from the US, Canadian Broadcasting Corp reported.

Earlier on Tuesday, Geng warned Washington in a statement to stop its campaign against Chinese enterprises, including Huawei.

"China calls on（呼吁） the US to treat（对待） Chinese companies in an objective and fair manner(方式)," Geng said in the statement, adding that the country will firmly defend（维护）the legitimate interests(合法利益) of Chinese enterprises.

"For some time, the US has been using its power to tarnish(玷污，varnish 消失) and crack down on specific Chinese enterprises in an attempt to（试图）strangle their lawful and legitimate operations. Those acts were motivated by strong political intentions（政治意图） and manipulation（操纵）," he said.

Huawei has denied committing any of the violations cited in the US charges. The Chinese telecommunications（通信） giant said in a statement（在声明中） on Tuesday that it tried to discuss the investigation（调查） with US prosecutors（公诉人） following the arrest of Meng in Vancouver, but that request was rejected.

The company noted the allegations（指控，charge ，accuse） in the trade secrets（商业机密） charges were already the subject of a US civil lawsuit that was settled.

Huawei added it is "not aware of any wrongdoing by Meng and believes the US courts will ultimately(最终) reach the same conclusion（结论）."

Meng was detained(扣留) in Vancouver at the request of the US on Dec 1 in connection with alleged violations（违反， breach） of US sanctions on Iran. She faces an extradition hearing on Wednesday.

On Friday, Canadian Ambassador to China John McCallum was asked to resign（辞职） due to his comment on the extradition of Meng. He said it would be "great for Canada" if the US drops(放弃) its extradition request against Meng.

Zhou Fangyin, a foreign policy researcher at the Guangdong Institute for International Strategies, said Meng's case is obviously(明显地，evidently) not a legal case（合法的案件）, but politically motivated(政治驱动的).

Meng's case is neither(既不) related to the national security of Canada, nor(也不) is it related to its economic interests, Zhou said. The attitude of the Canadian government reveals(揭露) how severely(严重地) this matter is politicized, he added.

Chinese brands lead domestic smartphone sales for 2018

China's domestic(本土的) mobile phone brands topped 2018 sales lists, while the country's market recorded an overall sluggish(无精打采的，行动迟缓的) year, data from Sino Market Research has shown.

The data also showed that Honor, a smartphone brand owned by Huawei, overtook(赶上，overturn, overrule 推翻) Apple's shipments to claim fourth spot with a 13 percent increase.

Oppo registered a total shipment of 76.37 million units, beating all other brands, although this was a 6 percent year-on-year drop for the company. Oppo was followed by Vivo, Huawei, Honor and Apple in terms of aggregate sales.

Over the past year, China's domestic mobile phone shipments reached 414 million units, dropping 15.6 percent year-on-year, said the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government think tank, in a report earlier this month.

It further said that 4G mobile phones accounted for 94.5 percent of the shipments, with total sales of 391 million units, a 15.3 percent drop.

Bucking the trend were Huawei, Honor, Vivo and Xiaomi, which all saw shipment growth in 2018, while the figures for Apple, Meizu and Samsung all dropped – 5 percent, 46 percent and 32 percent, respectively, Sino Market Research reported.

The top-five mobile phone brands by sales value were Apple, Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Honor, a separate list from the researching firm showed.

A new report shows China's migrant(移民) population faces many barriers integrating into cities(融入城市).

The report, jointly compiled by research institutes and government organizations including the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and Migrant Population Service Center under the National Health Commission, measures the integration of floating(流动) populations in 50 Chinese cities using four criteria — politics, economics, public service, and culture and psychology.

The 50 cities surveyed scored 51.62 out of 100 on average for integration of their migrant populations, according to the recently published report.

"Despite the progress we have achieved in helping floating populations integrate into cities, there remains a huge gap between reality and the ideal(理想与现实之间)," Xiao Zihua, director of the Migrant Population Service Center of the National Health Commission, was quoted as saying by Caixin.com.

"Migrant population" refers to(提及) those who leave their hometown to seek employment or education elsewhere.

The report shows less than 4 percent of migrants have secured a local hukou, or permanent residency permit(永久居住许可), in cities where they live. Besides(除了...以外) the difficulty in getting a hukou, the migrant population also faces barriers(障碍) such as high housing prices, low employment rates, and poor job security.

In 2014 only 10.76 percent of migrants owned their urban homes, while 73.19 percent lived in rental(租用的) housing.

The report also shows those born in the 1980s have become the majority of(大多数) the floating population — accounting for 64.7 percent of the total — and over half of the migrant population have a strong desire(强烈愿望) to settle in cities.

Statistics show China has a migrant population of 250 million. That means one out of six(6分之一) people are migrants without the same access to public services — such as children's education, social security and health care(健康医疗) — as their urban counterparts.

In 2014, the State Council issued(发行) a document(公文) to further reform the decades-old hukou system. It called for lifting all hukou restrictions for small towns and cities, loosening(放松) hukou restrictions of middle cities in an orderly way, and strictly(严格) controlling the population of large and super-large cities.

"The larger a city is, the harder to integrate," Xiao said.

"It is the large and super-large cities migrant populations most want to integrate with, while our urban development strategy is channeling(引导) them into small and middle cities, which are contradictory(矛盾的) (goals)," he added.

In 2017, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Beijing were the four cities attracting(吸引了) the most migrants, with a floating population of 9.72, 9.67, 8.18 and 7.94 million respectively. But in recent years, the migrant population in Beijing and Shanghai has dropped due to tighter(收紧的) controls on population growth.

Different regions(不同地区) in China have their own delicacies(菜肴) for Spring Festival. Li Yingxue checks out restaurants in the capital that offer specialities from around the country.

Twenty-third, eat the sticky candy; 24th, clean the house; 25th, fry the tofu(豆腐); 26th, stew(炖) the lamb; 27th, butcher the rooster(公鸡); 28th, leaven the dough; 29th, steam the buns; and 30th, stay up all night.

So goes a Beijing folk song that describes how people prepare for Spring Festival, starting from the 23rd day of the 12th lunar month. Most of the activities revolve around(围绕) food.

The Lunar New Year's Eve family-reunion dinner is the celebrations' main event. People from different areas have different traditions for that special meal.

Northerners eat dumplings. Shanghainese stew meats with egg dumplings. People in Guangdong and Hong Kong enjoy pencai, or poon choi, which literally translates as food served in small basins, as the main dish. All symbolize auspicious(吉利的，有前途的，有希望的) meanings.

The Ministry of Civil Affairs has said increased(加大) measures will be taken to improve(改进，改善) the national marriage database, with the aim of(目的在于) preventing bigamy(重婚) and marital fraud(婚姻欺骗）, China Youth Daily reported on Friday.

China established the national database in 2012 to handle(处理) marriage registration across 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities（自治区） on the Chinese mainland.

In the latest efforts in 2018, central government enabled the sharing of information on marriages registered both in China and abroad, to improve the accuracy verifying people's marital(婚姻的) statuses(状态) and prevent bigamy.

"We've been promoting the digital construction of marriage status information for a long time," said the head of the ministry's social affair bureau（机构）. "But there're also some problems." he added.

According to him, the ministry will speed up（加速，accelerate） the exchange of marriage registration information with courts and relevant（有关的） agencies, in order to keep the database updated and complete marriage records that haven't been included in the network.

The civil affairs authorities will enforce the memorandum（记录、备忘录） of cooperation jointly signed by central authorities to punish（惩罚） those with dishonest behaviors（不诚实的行为） in marriage registration.

Increased professional training will be given to staff（员工） working in marriage registration agencies to screen those who have lied in marriage registration.

Shanghai's first regulation on domestic waste management will take effect on July 1 after being approved at the annual session of the municipal(市政的) people's congress on Jan 31.

With some final changes made following the city congress deputies' review, the regulation was voted on the last day of the session, and was approved by a wide margin.

The full text of the regulation will be made public by Feb 15.

The regulation covers reducing the amount of garbage produced at source, ensuring separate transportation of different kinds of garbage, improving the waste treatment facilities and promoting social participation.

According to the regulation, if not requested by guests, hotels should not provide disposable slippers and shower caps, while restaurants and food delivery businesses should not provide disposable chopsticks and forks.

Government and public institutions are not allowed to use disposable cups in the office and should give priority in purchasing products made from recycled materials.

All the courier companies that operate in the city should use digital orders and environment friendly materials（有机材料） for packaging.

It requires people to sort household trash（生活垃圾） into four categories — dry garbage, wet garbage (kitchen waste), recyclables and hazardous waste — and individuals who fail to do so will be fined up to 200 yuan ($30). For companies and institutions, the fine can go up to 50,000 yuan. In addition, transport operators（运输员） can refuse to pick up the trash if it's not properly sorted.

The waste transport should use special vehicles with clear labels, and separate（分开，segregate 隔离、分开） transportation for different kinds of garbage.

For waste treatment companies, the regulation imposes strict requirements to ensure the treatment process won't contaminate（污染） the nearby（附近的） water and soil, or cause air or noise pollution.

The regulation（管控） asks the government to create monitoring and supervision mechanism（监管机制） to ensure the enforcement, release related inspection results, and put waste management as one performance indicator for officials.

Shanghai, a city of more than 24 million residents, produces more than 9 million metric tons of domestic garbage every year, which poses a big threat to（构成巨大威胁） the city's environment and sustainable development（可持续发展）.

Guangzhou, Beijing and Hangzhou of Zhejiang province have all passed similar regulations in recent years.

Guideline from Post Bureau（局，办事处） says sector(部门) should reuse more packaging materials(包装材料)

Concerns about the country's mounting trash problem prompted（促使、导致）the State Post Bureau to publish a guideline for green development of the express delivery industry, aiming to reduce the generation of waste and to encourage recycling and green packaging.

China's booming（蓬勃发展的） express delivery industry（快递运输业）used about 17.9 billion plastic bags, 8.6 billion cardboard（硬纸板）boxes and 330 million rolls of adhesive tape(胶带) in 2016, the bureau said.

That number is likely to have risen, given the number of deliveries in the country jumped from 31.35 billion in 2016 to more than 50 billion last year. This year it's expected to hit 60 billion.

Experts said making the industry green is necessary to curb（限制、抑制） pollution, because many of the materials currently used are not recyclable（可回收的）. But they also said the goal would be difficult to achieve without enhanced（增强）awareness（意识） of the importance of environmental protection among members of the public.

Express delivery enterprises（物流公司） should have containers to collect reusable packaging at their service outlets（服务站）, according to the guideline（指导原则）, which was issued in December.

They should also avoid using single-use, woven（编、织） plastic bags and increase the use of reusable bags and boxes. The big bags used in parcel（包裹）transportation should be reused at least 20 times, it said.

About 3.2 billion such big woven bags were used in 2016.

The guideline also said green packaging materials（绿色的包装材料）, such as those printed with environmentally friendly（环境友好的）, water-based ink should be given priority.

Disposal（处理） of waste remains a challenge for the express delivery industry（快递运输业）, said Li Tianjiao, an expert on green action with Cainiao Network, Alibaba's logistics arm.

A green logistics report published by the China Environmental Protection Foundation last year said paper packaging, which had a recycling rate of about 90 percent in 2017, is the most-recycled waste generated by the express delivery sector. However, many of the plastic products it uses must be incinerated - generating power - or disposed of in landfills（废弃物填埋）.

The State Post Bureau said waste from the express delivery industry accounted for about 93 percent of the growth in domestic waste in big cities.

"Under the circumstances, it's imperative（不可避免的，势在必行的） to promote(促进，推动) green packaging," Li said.

He also noted the importance of developing and researching（探究、研究）cost-efficient green models. Although Cainiao and its partners had been piloting the application of different green packaging solutions since 2017, the increased cost associated with lowering environmental impacts remained a challenge.

The guideline also called for the increased use of biodegradable（可降解的） plastic packaging, saying consumers should be offered the option of using green packaging for their deliveries.

Ba Ning, executive deputy director of the China Post Research Institute's testing center, said this would help to greatly reduce the environmental impact of plastic packaging used in express deliveries.

Under natural conditions（自然环境下）, it takes about 200 years for the common plastic packaging currently used in China to degrade. But more than 90 percent of the materials in biodegradable plastic packaging could degrade in just six months under certain conditions.

With favorable（适宜的） humidity（湿度） and temperature（温度）, biodegradable（生物降解） plastic packaging could degrade into carbon dioxide（二氧化碳）and water within a year, Science and Technology Daily quoted Ba as saying.

However, Ba said, using biodegradable plastic bags could more than double the cost of plastic packaging, which would be a challenge to the development of the express delivery industry.

Increased environmental protection awareness（提高环境保护意识） among the public was needed to help address the cost challenge because consumers with such awareness would be willing to pay more for green delivery.

The cost of biodegradable plastic packaging could be 30 percent more than common plastic, Chen Shunfeng, general manager of a ZTO Express branch in Shandong province, was quoted as saying by China Economic Herald.

Consumers seeking(寻求) quality products, services, shoring up（支撑住） domestic demand（本地内需）

Chinese consumers opened their wallet during Spring Festival, not only on things like digital home appliances(数字家用电器) and imported fresh food but also on experiences（经历） such as travel and entertainment（娱乐）, government figures showed.

Shopping, dining out（在外吃饭）, travel and entertainment accounted for most of the consumer spending during the week-long holiday （一星期假期）. Analysts and officials said the strong domestic demand will inject further growth momentum（发展势头） into the economy in 2019 as the government unveils（使公之于众） more policies to spur（刺激） consumption.

Spending on retail（零售） and food services during the Spring Festival period（期间）, from Feb 4 to Sunday this year, exceeded 1 trillion yuan ($147.41 billion) for the first time, up 8.5 percent year-on-year, according to the Ministry of Commerce（商业部门）.

The ministry said a key term for Lunar New Year holiday spending was "seeking higher quality" as the government's emphasis on upgrading（升级） consumption continues. Emerging areas for spending such as the internet, customized products, experiences, digital products and services were growth areas during the holiday.

Zheng Wen, director-general of the ministry's department of circulation industry development, said online sales have become an important engine（引擎） to stimulate（刺激） domestic spending and imports. "Durable consumer goods with high-tech features and branded foreign products have huge commercial（商业的） potential," Zheng said.

Chinese e-commerce giant JD reported robust（强劲的） sales between Feb 3 and Friday, with sales revenue jumping 42.74 percent year-on-year. Smartphones, computers and home appliances were the top three items on JD in terms of sales value.

Chinese consumers tend to buy high-quality and diversified（多样化的） products, the company said. Kitchenware（厨房用具） sales posted the strongest growth — 399 percent year-on-year. That was followed by furniture（家具） and luggage（皮箱）, with their respective sales revenue up 185 percent and 148 percent, JD reported.

China UnionPay, the country's largest bank card operater by market share, saw its total transaction（交易） volume over the holiday period reach 1.16 trillion yuan, jumping 71.4 percent year-on-year, the company said on Monday.

"Consumers are more willing to spend money this year. Whether it is filial（子女的） piety（虔诚） to the elderly（老人） or rewarding children or themselves, trading volume has kept growing. Spending on entertainment and travel also grew fast," said Chen Han, a data analyst at China UnionPay.

Consumption has become the biggest driver for the economy, contributing（贡献了） 76.2 percent of the country's economic growth last year, up 18.6 percentage points（百分点） over the previous year, the National Bureau of Statistics said.

"Judging（判断） from major economic indicators, domestic demand has become a decisive（决定性的） force of China's economic growth," said Wang Bin, deputy director-general of the ministry's department of market operation and consumption promotion.

Several factors will support steady（稳定的） consumer spending growth in China. Residential（住宅的） income has been increasing fast and deeper pockets facilitate（帮助，促进） more spending. The second China International Import Expo in Shanghai will also offer more access to global products, Wang said.

Wang Jun, a researcher at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, expects more favorable（讨人喜欢的，有利的,赞同的） policies to further boost（推动） domestic shopping this year as nationwide（全国范围的） tax cuts continue.

The National Development and Reform Commission and other government agencies issued（发布） a plan last month to build a powerful domestic consumption market, putting forward 24 policies and measures to promote（促进）consumer spending in six areas, including telecommunications, automobiles and elderly and nursing care.

"China will continue to be the world's largest market for products and services, such as industrial goods, food and healthcare（卫生保健） services, which will offer enormous（巨大的） opportunities to global companies," Wang added.

Smoking Among Teens Has Stopped Declining. And Vaping(抽电子烟) Is to Blame, Officials Say
难度：六级/考研单词：533读后感：21来源：Time生词过滤：考研

(NEW YORK) — Cigarette smoking rates have stopped falling among U.S. kids, and health officials believe youth vaping is responsible（负责的）.
For decades, the percentage of high school and middle school students who smoked cigarettes had been declining fairly steadily（稳定地）. For the past three years, it has flattened, according to new numbers released Monday.
There may be several reasons, but a recent boom in vaping is the most likely explanation, said Brian King of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“We were making progress, and now you have the introduction of a product that is heavily popular among youth that has completely erased that progress,” King said.
The CDC findings come from a national survey conducted last spring of more than 20,000 middle and high school students. It asked if they had used any tobacco products in the previous month. Some of the findings had been released before, including the boom(暴涨，激增) in vaping.
Experts attribute the vaping increase to the exploding（突然的）popularity of newer versions of e-cigarettes, like those by Juul Labs Inc. of San Francisco. The products resemble computer flash drives, can be recharged in USB ports and can be used discreetly（小心地，谨慎地） — including in school bathrooms and even in classrooms.
According to the new CDC data, about 8 percent of high schoolers said they had recently smoked cigarettes in 2018, and about 2 percent of middle schoolers did. Those findings were about the same seen in similar surveys in 2016 and 2017.
It also found that about 2 in 5 high school students who used a vaping or tobacco product used more than one kind, and that the most common combination was e-cigarettes（电子烟） and cigarettes. Also, about 28 percent of high school e-cigarette users said they vaped 20 or more days in the previous month — nearly a 40 percent jump from the previous year.
Smoking, the nation’s leading cause（主要原因） of preventable（可预防的，可阻止的）illness, is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths each year. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration bans the sale of e-cigarettes and tobacco products to those under 18.
E-cigarettes are generally considered better than cigarettes for adults who are already addicted to nicotine（尼古丁）. But health officials have worried for years that electronic cigarettes could lead kids to switch to smoking traditional cigarettes.
“I think the writing is on the wall,” with research increasingly suggesting e-cigarettes are becoming a gateway to regular cigarettes, said Megan Roberts, an Ohio State University researcher.
There is, however, some split（分歧）of opinion among health researchers. Some had linked e-cigarettes to an unusually large drop in teen smoking a few years ago, and they say it’s not clear to what extent the decline in smoking has stalled（失速的）or to what degree vaping is to blame.
Cigarette smoking is still declining in some states. And another large survey found that smoking has continued to drop among 12th graders, though not in younger school kids.
“It’s not clear yet what’s going on and it’s best to not jump to any conclusions,” said David Levy, a Georgetown University researcher.

The secret to Japan’s precise forecast of the dates when cherry blossoms bloom
赏樱季：日本樱花花况预测为何如此精准？
难度：雅思/托福/专四单词：545读后感：99来源：Quartz 

Hanami in Tokyo, Japan.
Each spring(每到春天), Japan celebrates the season of cherry blossoms, or “sakura.” Viewing parties and picnics underneath the pale-pink trees are a national pastime（消遣，娱乐）, recognizing the fact that beauty and life are fleeting（稍纵即逝） and that a new season has begun.
The excitement around sakura is not just philosophically（富有哲理性的） sound, however. The flower is also an economic powerhouse. “Sakura season is big business,” as The Japan Times puts it.
In the weeks before the flowers bloom and the parties start, shops display countless（数不胜数的） themed items（主题项目）, from cherry-blossom beer to flower-flavored chips and other goods perfect for picnicking in the spring. Last year, stores sold cherry blossom Pepsi, for example. And tourists come to the country in droves hoping to enjoy this uniquely Japanese tradition.
That makes predicting exactly when the blooms will appear very serious work. In 1951, Japanese meteorologists began trying to get ahead of the blooms for better planning. Today, the “sakura zensen,” or cherry blossom front, is a closely-monitored affair that’s reported nationally as spring approaches（临近）. The reports draw on observations from national weather agencies, algorithms, park managers—and 10,000 citizen scientists.
In 2004, the Chiba-based company Weathernews, Inc. began enlisting the assistance of citizens, who register on the company website and app to be official blossom monitors. Now, there are 10,000 individuals who each sign up to watch a local cherry blossom tree carefully all year and regularly report on the state of its buds（在花蕾期）, sending in photos for meteorologists to study. Miku Toma, a company spokesperson, tells The Japan Times, “Cherry blossom forecasting is impossible for us without this system.”
Predicting the blooms can be tricky（复杂） because their arrival date depends on the weather year-round and in the winter weeks. Warmer temperatures generally mean blossoms appear earlier, while cold temperatures indicate（表明）a longer wait ahead. In the fall, for example, there was concern that extreme weather that prompted some trees to blossom unseasonably in autumn might mar this spring’s hanami, or sakura-viewing activities.
But now meteorologists believe this year’s sakura will be as splendid（壮观的） as ever. “[A]lthough cherry trees bloomed out of season last October due to a loss of leaves caused by wind and salt damage from a series of tropical cyclones affecting Japan in September, it is thought that the impact on this spring’s cherry blossoms will be minimal,” Weathernews announced on Feb. 5.
The company also laid out upcoming sakura spectacle dates across Japan. Blooms will be visible in Tokyo on March 18 through March 28. That gives city dwellers（居民） just 10 days to enjoy the canopy of pastels that will emerge. ”Nationally, it looks as though the blossoms will be slightly later than last year, when they appeared earlier than usual,” the company reports.
In Hokkaido, up north, the first flowers are expected to emerge on April 27, just ahead of Golden Week, which begins on April 29 and is a week-long celebration of national holidays. For the intrepid blossom-watcher who’s willing to travel around the country in pursuit of fleeting beauty, that means all of spring will be one big party.

Celebrities' tax payments published
明星2018年度纳税榜曝光
难度：四级单词：218读后感：133来源：China Daily生词过滤：考研

The art studio of youth idol and singer Zhang Yixing tops the annual list for Chinese celebrities' tax payments in Hengdian, Dongyang, one of China's biggest film and television production centers, according to a list released by local authorities on Wednesday.
The 27-year-old Zhang paid 19.13 million yuan ($2.83 million) in 2018, followed by(紧跟的) actresses Yang Mi (15.53 million yuan) and Jing Tian (10.43 million yuan).
Hengdian Studios, also a tourist attraction, is dubbed China's film and TV series production hub, where about 70 percent of the country's films and TV series are shot annually. A number of ancient buildings（古老建筑）, including the palace of Qin Shihuang, China's first emperor（皇帝）, have been replicated there.
An industry-wide（行业范围内的）tax probe emerged across the nation's entertainment sector after Fan Bingbing, one of China's most famous actresses, was fined（罚款）884 million yuan by the tax authorities for tax evasion（逃税） last year.
So far, a total of 11.75 billion yuan ($1.73 billion) in unpaid taxes have been filed with tax authorities by Dec 31 last year, after the film and TV industry examined its taxpaying practices, according to Xinhua News Agency.
Among the filings, 11.55 billion yuan have been paid, according to the State Administration of Taxation.

Daniel Gerhard Brown's one of the best-selling（热卖）authors and a global publishing success, most well known for his thriller novels（恐怖小说）, including the Robert Langdon stories, Angels & Demons, The Da Vinci Code and The Lost Symbol etc.
In between an intriguing story line on the controversial（有争议的）subjects, plenty of twists and suspense, Brown slips in some life-advice that forces one to pause and ponder.
Here are some incredibly thought-provoking quotes from some of his books.
Everything is possible. The impossible just takes longer.
Great minds are always feared by lesser minds.
Sooner or later we've all got to let go of our past.
Nothing is more creative... nor destructive... than a brilliant mind with a purpose.
Our minds sometimes see what our hearts wish were true.
Sometimes all it takes is a tiny shift of perspective to see something familiar in a totally new light.
The more man learned, the more he realized he did not know.
Enjoy it. One way or another, your days are numbered.
Sometimes the only choice is the lesser of two evils.
The decisions of our past are the architects of our present.

How to stop overthinking your decisions
如何告别纠结？
难度：雅思/托福/专四单词：717读后感：75来源：Others生词过滤：考研

What’s the one thing on your plate that you’ve been putting off making a decision on? Whether it’s a simple decision such as choosing which duct-cleaning company to hire or a more complex one such as whether to accept a new job offer, sitting on a decision can make you feel like you’re paralyzed. You tell yourself, “that’s enough, just pick one and move on.” But the second you make a choice, thoughts of “am I doing the right thing?” start to flood in.
Amy Morin, psychotherapist and author of 13 Things Mentally Strong Women Don’t Do, says overthinking a decision is not only unproductive and hinders（阻止）you from making any progress, it can also cause some serious health consequences, including increased anxiety and depression, poor quality of sleep, and unhealthy coping skills such as binge eating.
Morin dedicates an entire chapter of her book to the problem of overthinking, and although she says women tend to overthink decisions more than men do, ruminating（反复思考）on a decision has the same negative impacts on both genders.
Try these strategies to avoid the negative consequences of overthinking:
Put a Deadline on Your Thoughts
To avoid over-ruminating about a decision, give yourself a time frame（构架）to think about it. By telling yourself, “I’m going to make this decision by 2 p.m. today and whatever I decide is going to be fine” means you are giving yourself permission to think about it, but not allowing it to take over other parts of your day.
Morin suggests asking yourself what a reasonable amount of time is to be thinking about this issue. If it’s a small issue such as what paint color to paint your office, perhaps a deadline of 10 minutes is sufficient（足够的）; whereas a larger decision such as whether to accept a new job offer in another city may warrant a couple of days of thought.
Schedule Your Thinking Time
One of the problems overthinkers often face is thinking about their problems all day long, or at inopportune times, such as during an important meeting. To avoid this, Morin suggests scheduling a specific time where you give yourself the freedom to think about the issue you need to make a decision about. If thoughts about the issue creep into your brain before your scheduled thinking time, telling yourself “No, I’m going to think about that after dinner, not during this meeting” can help you to push those thoughts away, knowing you’ll come back to it later.
Know the Difference Between Problem Solving and Worrying
While for most of us, overthinking stems from a fear(源于一种恐惧) of the consequences（后果）of taking action A or B, Morin says those who are chronic（习惯性的）overthinkers often believe that they can solve a problem by continuing to pound away, thinking about it. But worrying, Morin says, is not the same as actively solving a problem. While dwelling on a problem, thinking “this is horrible, I can’t handle this” or rehashing things that happened in the past are an unproductive use of your time, thinking about what steps you can take to improve the situation or actively thinking of a solution to the problem are helpful toward moving forward. Becoming aware of when your thinking is unhelpful and when it’s actively problem solving can help you to ensure your time spent thinking isn’t just adding to your stress.
Take a Break
You know the expression “sleeping on a problem,” well, that’s because sometimes we’re better at solving a problem when we’re not thinking about it. “Sometimes we make better decisions when we let those ideas percolate in our brain,” says Morin. Letting the inactive parts of your brain work through the problem can let the answer come to you when you’re not expecting it.
When you find yourself overthinking about a problem, try to change the channel in your brain by moving on to another subject or changing your physical space by going for a walk, or moving your laptop to a conference room to work on something else.

Study: As Ice Melts, Greenland Could Become Big Sand Exporter
难度：六级/考研单词：473读后感：23来源：VOA生词过滤：考研
FILE - The Greenland ice sheet is seen in southeastern Greenland, Aug. 3, 2017.

OSLO —
Greenland（格陵兰）could start to export sand in a rare positive spinoff from global warming that is melting the island's vast ice sheet and washing large amounts of sediment into the sea, scientists said Monday.
Mining of sand and gravel, widely used in the construction industry（建筑业）, could boost the economy for Greenland's 56,000 population who have wide powers of self-rule within Denmark（丹麦） but rely heavily on subsidies from Copenhagen（哥本哈根）.
By mining sand, "Greenland could benefit from the challenges brought by climate change," a team of scientists in Denmark and the United States wrote in the journal Nature Sustainability(可持续).
The study, headlined "Promises and perils of sand exploitation in Greenland," said the Arctic（北极的） island would have to assess risks of coastal（沿海的）mining, especially（尤其是）to fisheries（捕鱼业）.
Rising global temperatures are melting the Greenland ice sheet（冰块）, which locks up enough water to raise global sea levels by about seven meters (23 ft) if it ever all thawed, and carrying ever more sand and gravel into coastal fjords.
FILE - A man walks to his boat past a number of abandoned and dry-docked boats in the town of Tasiilaq, Greenland, June 15, 2018.
"You can think of it [the melting ice] as a tap that pours out sediment to the coast," said lead author Mette Bendixen, a researcher at the University of Colorado's Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research.
Worldwide(世界范围的) demand for sand totaled about 9.55 billion tons in 2017 with a market value of $99.5 billion and is projected to reach almost $481 billion in 2100, driven by rising demand and likely shortages, the study said.
That meant a rare opportunity for the island.
"Normally the Arctic peoples are among those who really feel climate change — the eroding coast, less permafrost," said Bendixen. "This is a unique situation because of the melting ice sheet."
David Boertmann of Aarhus University, who was not involved in the study, said there was already some local mining of sand for the domestic construction industry in Greenland.
Drawbacks for Greenland, common to other mining projects on the island ranging from uranium to rare earth minerals, include the distance to markets in Europe and North America, he said.
Still, Bendixen said sand was already often transported long distances, such as to Los Angeles from Vancouver or from Australia to Dubai.
"At the moment it is an inexpensive resource(廉价的资源), but it will become more expensive," she said.
The study said that sand and gravel might also be used in the future to reinforce（加固）beaches and coastlines at risk of rising sea levels, caused in part by Greenland's thaw（解冻）.

China's Alipay mobile payment available at major US pharmacy store chain
支付宝走进美国最大连锁药店
难度：四级单词：300读后感：131来源：China Daily生词过滤：考研

NEW YORK - Consumers now can use China's leading online payment platform Alipay when shopping at Walgreens, one of the largest pharmacy store chains in the United States, said a joint announcement on Wednesday.
Alipay is currently available at 3,000 Walgreens stores including cities where Chinese consumers travel the most such as New York City, San Francisco and Las Vegas, said the statement. By April, Alipay's availability will expand to(扩展到) more than 7,000 Walgreens locations across the United States.
"This collaboration has particular significance for our Chinese customer population, who now has a new way to experience Walgreens," Richard Ashworth, president of Operations with Walgreens, said in the statement.
Operated by Ant Financial Services Group, an affiliate company of China's Alibaba Group, Alipay users can hail a taxi, book a hotel, buy movie tickets, pay utility bills, make appointments with doctors, or purchase wealth management products directly from within the app.
In addition to online payments, Alipay is expanding to in-store offline payments both inside and outside China（国内外）.
"This is a key strategic partnership for achieving awareness in the United States, as Walgreens is one of the country's largest drugstore chains," said Wang Yulei, general manager of Alipay North America.
According to Wang, Alipay's in-store payment service is covering over 40 countries and regions across the world.
A January report published by global measurement and data analytics company Nielsen showed that mobile payment has overtaken cash for the first time among Chinese tourists traveling overseas.
More than two-thirds of Chinese tourists said they used their smartphones to pay abroad in 2018 and nearly 60 percent of surveyed merchants saw growth in both foot traffic and revenue, after adopting Chinese mobile payment methods, according to the report.

What the break-up of the world’s richest couple means for Amazon
和世界上最有钱的人离婚是一种怎样的体验？
难度：六级/考研单词：533读后感：62来源：The Economist生词过滤：考研

“WHEN YOU have loving and supportive people in your life, like MacKenzie…you end up being able to take risks.” So declared Jeff Bezos, boss of Amazon, the e-commerce giant, last April. This affirmation by the planet’s richest man of the contribution of his wife of 25 years to the company (she was in the founding team) takes on a new significance now that the power couple is preparing to split(分开).

When a founder divorces it can affect firms and shareholders in several ways. Most consequential are changes in corporate control. In the case of Wynn Resorts, a casino group, for example, its founder, Steve Wynn, was challenged for control by his former wife, Elaine, after a bitter divorce in 2010. She became the largest shareholder in the group and demanded governance reforms.

Mr Bezos is not thought to have a prenuptial agreement. In the state of Washington, where the couple mainly live, Ms Bezos is entitled to half of her husband’s $137bn fortune (if the divorce is filed elsewhere, her share may be lower). Critically, Mr Bezos owns a smaller proportion of his firm than other tech founders: whereas Mark Zuckerberg, for example, controls 51.3% of Facebook’s voting rights through a dual-class structure, Mr Bezos controls only about 16% of Amazon and has no special voting rights.

The divorce could weaken his hand in two ways. His stake could be cut to 8% (though Ms Bezos may accept some cash or put her shares in a trust), changing the balance of power with the largest institutional investors—Vanguard has a 6% stake, for example. And she may demand a board seat. It is conceivable that she might then oppose her ex-husband’s plans at the company. She might push for pay rises for workers, say, that hurt profits (Amazon is already under pressure in this regard).

To reassure shareholders, reckons William Klepper of Columbia Business School, author of “The CEO’s Boss”, Amazon’s board must now hold discussions with Mr Bezos about how any share transfer will take place and communicate relevant points to shareholders. The board will need to be vigilant on other fronts, too, says David Larcker of Stanford Graduate School of Business. Executives going through a divorce often get distracted, which explains why a company spokesman insisted this week that “Jeff remains focused”. Studies have also shown that a big reduction in wealth through divorce can lead a boss to make more aggressive corporate bets in the hope of clawing back riches. Some boards have even awarded CEOs extra pay to tamp down such behaviour.

Mr Bezos’s best defence may not be legal manoeuvring, but continuing to do his job well. Amazon has outperformed the S&P 500 index by 33% over the last year, and by over 2,000% over the past decade. A recent survey by Stanford found him (and not Tesla’s Elon Musk) to be “the most difficult CEO to replace”. For now, the love affair between Mr Bezos and investors is still going strong.

Former Apple lawyer charged with insider trading
难度：六级/考研单词：220读后感：28来源：BBC生词过滤：考研

US prosecutors have charged(指控) a former top Apple lawyer with insider trading.
Gene Levoff is accused of（被指控） using confidential（私密） information to trade the firm's securities for personal gain（自己私利）.
Mr Levoff, who was responsible for ensuring compliance with Apple's insider trading policies, is accused of breaching（违反） those policies on several occasions.
Apple fired him last year after being contacted by authorities and conducting an internal investigation（内部调查）.
The US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) said Mr Levoff engaged in insider trading various times（多次） between 2011 and 2016.
"Levoff's alleged exploitation of his access to Apple's financial information was particularly egregious given his responsibility for implementing the company's insider trading compliance policy," Antonia Chion, associate director of the SEC's division of enforcement, said in a statement.
"The SEC is committed to pursuing insiders who breach their duties to investors."
In 2011 and 2012, Apple's former head of corporate law made $245,000 (£193,801) in profits by engaging in insider trading, the SEC said.
Mr Levoff also traded Apple securities ahead of three quarterly earnings announcements in 2015 and 2016, making approximately（大约） $382,000 in combined profits and losses avoided.
The charge（指控）s carry a maximum（最长） sentence（审判） of 20 years in prison and a fine（惩罚） of up to $5m.

For thousands of years, weapons（武器）went where humans
thrust, threw or propelled them. In the past century, they
have grown cleverer: more able to duck（迅速前进）and weave（迂回前进）to their targets;
more able to select which of many ships, tanks or aircraft to
strike（打击）; and more able to wait for the right target to turn up（出现）. Increasingly（越来越多地）,
such weapons can be let loose on the battlefield（战场）with
little or no supervision by humans.
The world has not entered the age of（进入...时代） the killer robot, at least
not yet. Today’s autonomous weapons are mostly（大多是）static systems
to shoot down incoming threats in self-defence（自我防御）, or missiles fired

weapons will be able to travel farther（更远地） from their human
operators, move from one place to another and attack a wider（更广范围内）
range of targets with humans “out of the loop”
(see Briefing). Will they make war even more

little agreement. More than two dozen states
(including Austria, the Vatican, Brazil and nuclear-armed Pakistan),
backed by increasingly vocal activists, support a pre-emptive
ban on “fully autonomous weapons”. They point to campaigns
against anti-personnel landmines（潜在冲突）, cluster munitions（军火）,
and biological and chemical weapons(生化武器) as evidence that this can
succeed. Most big powers—among them America, Russia and
Britain—retort that the laws of war are already good enough to
control autonomous weapons（自动化武器）. Some argue（辩称）that such weapons
can be more accurate and humane（仁慈） than today’s.
A third group of countries, led by the likes of France and Germany,
is urging greater transparency（透明的） and scrutiny. Autonomous
systems make wars more unpredictable（不可预测） and harder to supervise（监控）;
and they make it harder to assign responsibility(责任) for what happens
during conflict. This third group is surely right to try to impose
at least some controls.
The laws of war are still the right place to start. They do not
seek to ban war, but to limit its worst excesses. Among other
things, they require that warriors discriminate properly between
combatants（战士） and civilians（平民）, and ensure that collateral（旁系的）damage is
proportionate to military gains. Military actions must therefore
be judged in their context. But that judgment is hard for machines
to form.
In addition, new rules will be difficult to negotiate and monitor.
For one thing, it is hard to control what does not yet exist
and cannot be precisely（准确地） defined. How long may a drone（无人机） hover
above the battlefield, empowered to strike, before it has slipped（打滑）
out of the hands of the humans who sent it there? The difference
between machines under human control and those beyond it
may be a few thousand lines of secret code.
That said, two principles（原则）make sense. First, the more a weapon
is permitted to roam about over large areas,
or for long periods, the more important it is that
humans remain “on the loop”—able to supervise
its actions and step in if necessary, as circumstances
change. That requires robust（强有力的） communication（通信）
links. If these are lost or jammed（阻断了）,
the weapon should hold（停止攻击）fire, or return.
A second tenet（信条）is that autonomous systems,
whether civilian ones like self-driving cars or
those that drop bombs, should be “explainable（可识别的）”. Humans should
be able to understand how a machine took a decision when
things go wrong. On one point, at least, all states agree: that the
buck must stop with humans. “Accountability cannot be transferred（转让给）
to machines,” noted a report of the ccw in October. Intelligent
or not, weapons are tools used by humans, not moral agents
in their own right. Those who introduce a weapon into the battlefield
must remain on the hook for its actions.
A good approach（办法）is a Franco-German proposal(建议) that countries
should share more information on how they assess new weapons;
allow others to observe demonstrations of new systems;
and agree on a code of conduct for their development and use.
This will not end（停止）the horrors（恐怖） of war, or even halt（中止） autonomous
weapons. But it is a realistic（现实的） and sensible（明智的）way forward. As weapons
get cleverer, humans must keep up.

The air in modern homes and offices is
pretty clean, but not as clean as it might
be. Often, it contains small amounts of
volatile, toxic, organic compounds such as
benzene, formaldehyde, butadiene, carbon
tetrachloride, naphthalene and chloroform.
Chronic exposure to(长期暴露在） these is a bad
thing, so clearing them out of the air people
breathe is widely accepted as worthwhile（值得的）.
Finding an effective way to do so has
proved difficult. But Stuart Strand, Long
Zhang and Ryan Routsong, of the University
of Washington, in Seattle, think they
have succeeded. As they report in Environmental
Science and Technology, their method
involves splicing a gene from a rabbit
into a popular indoor plant nicknamed
Devil’s vine—a type of ivy that is so called
because it is famously difficult to kill.
The idea of employing plants, both unmodified
and transgenic, to de-pollute the
atmosphere inside buildings has been
around for decades—but has met with only
qualified success. One experiment involving
unmodified spider plants, for example,
showed that they are indeed capable of
scrubbing formaldehyde from the air. The
drawback is that to make much of a difference
in a space as large as a house would require
turning most of the rooms into spider-
plant forests. Tobacco plants fitted
with a bacterial gene for a formaldehyde destroying
enzyme were three times more
effective at formaldehyde scrubbing than
those without it. The trouble in their case
was that tobacco plants flower indoors,
and their pollen can thus spread genetically
engineered material (about which some
people are paranoid) to unexpected places.
Dr Strand, Dr Zhang and Mr Routsong thus
sought something suitably transgenic, but
that does not flower indoors.
The plant they settled on was Devil’s
vine, precisely because of its robustness.
The gene they picked was for cytochrome
p450 2e1, a mammalian enzyme that oxidises
a wide range of volatile organic compounds,
including benzene, chloroform,
trichloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride.
With the help of a bacterium, they
were able to ferry the rabbit version of the
gene into the plant’s chromosomes, and
thus to engineer a type of Devil’s vine capable
of producing cytochrome p450 2e1.
To test the effectiveness of their idea,
the researchers put their modified ivy to
work inside chambers filled with air containing
high levels of either benzene or
chloroform. The plants performed well, reducing
benzene levels from 2,000 milligrams
per cubic metre to 250 over the
course of eight days, and chloroform levels
from 800 to near zero over the course of 11.
Unmodified versions of Devil’s vine, tested
for comparison, reduced benzene only
from 2,000 to 1,400 milligrams per cubic
metres over the same eight-day period, and
had no statistically significant effect on
chloroform levels at all. Genetically modified
Devil’s vine may thus prove the answer
to the question of how to clean up household
air—though perhaps it might be marketed
under a slightly different name.

Opinion divided over homework regulations
教育部将出台课外作业规定，教师看法不一
难度：四级单词：212读后感：174来源：Shine生词过滤：考研

Opinion is divided over the Ministry of Education's plans to regulate(管理) homework, and the local education commission's plans on the same matter are bound to attract similar polemic（debate）.
Two city documents in preparation will define the “bottom line” and provide guidance to schools on “scientific, normative and effective” homework.
Schools will be required to communicate with families and keep children’s homework appropriate（合适的）.
The Ministry of Education is to forbid（阻止） teachers from using apps like WeChat and QQ to assign homework or to ask parents to check their children’s answers.
Some teachers have welcomed the regulation as they are frequently（往往） disturbed by parents after work, but the principal of a primary school in Shanghai said apps are just tools and the ban would not fundamentally solve the problem.
She said that even after banning teachers from assigning homework via apps, parents will still ask each other about homework and check answers. Some homework is actually given by parents themselves or by crammers.
"I think parents’ anxiety stems from uncertainty about their children’s future, insufficient social support and out-of-date concepts of success,” she said. “It will take a long time to solve this problem.”

A 25-year battle to improve(改进) the image of McDonald’s
麦当劳25年的蜕变之路
难度：雅思/托福/专四单词：791读后感：44来源：The Economist生词过滤：考研
Do you want ethics with that?

EVERY DAY McDonald’s serves 69m customers, more than the population of Britain or France. The company has what is estimated to（被评估为）be the most valuable（有价值）fast-food brand in the world, cherished as a cheap dining option for families.
But do consumers perceive（视...为）McDonald’s as a socially or environmentally responsible company? If they do not, it is in spite of the best efforts of Bob Langert. In 1988, he took a temporary(临时的) assignment managing a furore over polystyrene “clamshells” in which the company’s burgers were served, and which were being damned for their contribution to America’s litter（垃圾） problem. That turned into a 25-year career (he has since left the firm) dealing with（处理）the chain’s various negative external effects.
It was a Herculean task, akin to being fashion consultant to Steve Bannon. Apart from litter, he had to deal with animal welfare, environmental destruction, obesity（肥胖症） and workers’ rights. When he began, the company’s mascot was being dubbed “Ronald McToxic” because of the clamshell problem. But he had more success than outsiders might think. His book “The Battle to Do Good: Inside McDonald’s Sustainability Journey” is a must-read even for those who are cynical about the business of corporate social responsibility.
At times, the fast-food chain did not help itself. In the 1990s, it sued two Greenpeace activists for producing leaflets about its practices. The ensuing “McLibel” trial gave the claims worldwide publicity and was described as the world’s biggest corporate-PR disaster. Mr Langert tried to reduce the damage. The company consulted panels of independent experts and engaged with campaigning groups. On occasion it aimed to keep one step ahead of the activists—McDonald’s took action even when there was little sign of public concern. Shaving one inch off the napkins(纸巾) saved 3m lbs of paper annually, for example, but few consumers noticed.
Environmentalists did attack（攻击） the firm for its impact on the Amazon rainforest, saying trees were being cut down to make room for cattle pasture or the expansion of soy farming for cattle feed. In 1989 the company announced that it “never has and never will buy beef from recently deforested rainforests” and it has also worked to limit the expansion of soy farming in the region. The rise of veganism amid doubts about the health effects of eating meat have given McDonald’s new worries.
Accomplishing change is not just a matter of the company snapping its fingers. Most McDonald’s restaurants are operated by franchisees and its goods are bought from a wide range of suppliers, so three or four layers may separate the McDonald’s head office and the cattle-rancher who supplies the firm’s beef.
In the late 1990s, after complaints from campaign groups about the living conditions of hens, Mr Langert visited an egg facility to find that conditions（环境） were indeed terrible（糟糕）. In August 2000 the firm said it would buy eggs only from suppliers that gave hens 72 square inches of space, compared with an industry average of 48 square inches. Suppliers resisted（抵抗）so strongly that McDonald’s had to find new sources for its eggs. But those who complied（遵从） found that the mortality rates（死亡率） of hens decreased and egg-laying rates increased, offsetting the extra costs.
Mr Langert found it took a long time to get agreement within the company on a particular subject and then to persuade suppliers to comply. But once he reached that stage, he had enormous clout; McDonald’s is the largest purchaser of beef and pork in America, as well as the second-largest buyer of chicken. Another victory was persuading a supplier to phase out the use of gestation stalls for sows which make it impossible for the animals to move.
Human working conditions also caused the company trouble. One day Mr Langert got a call from a Catholic bishop who was concerned about（关心） the low wages paid to tomato-pickers. Another issue（问题）was the use of “trans fats” to cook the restaurant’s fries, which were deemed to increase the risk of heart disease; it took six years for the chain to phase out the practice. But the company has also added more salads and healthy options.
Was all the effort worth it? It seems likely that many of the people who care a lot about these issues would never eat a fast-food burger in the first place. But Mr Langert did more than most to reduce environmental waste and animal cruelty（残忍）. A decent career record for an obviously decent man.

Women’s brains are 'four years younger' than men’s, study finds
研究发现：女性的脑袋比男性年轻4岁
难度：雅思/托福/专四单词：693读后感：29来源：Guardian生词过滤：考研

Women’s brains are nearly four years younger than men’s, at least in how they burn fuel, according to scans(扫描) performed by US researchers.
Scientists found that healthy women have a “metabolic brain age” that is persistently younger than men’s of the same chronological age. The difference is apparent from early adulthood and remains into old age.
The finding suggests(表明) that changes in how the brain uses energy over a person’s lifetime proceed more gradually in women than they do in men. While researchers are unsure of（不确定）the medical consequences, it may help explain why women tend to（倾向于）stay mentally sharp for longer.
“Brain metabolism changes with age but what we noticed is that a good deal of the variation（变化） we see is down to sex differences,” said Marcus Raichle, a neurobiologist at Washington University school of medicine in St Louis. “If you look at how brain metabolism predicts（预测）a person’s age, women come out looking about four years younger than they are.”
The scientists used a brain scanning technique called positron emission（释放） tomography to measure the flow of oxygen and glucose（葡萄糖） in the brains of 121 women and 84 men aged 20 to 82. The scans revealed（揭示了） how sugar was being turned into energy in different parts of the volunteers’ brains.
In babies and young children, a process called aerobic glycolysis is increased to grow and mature the developing brain. It is scaled down in adolescents and young adults, then drops steadily（平稳地） in older people until it reaches a very low level by the time people reach their 60s.
To see how brain metabolism differed between the sexes, the researchers used a computer algorithm to predict people’s ages based on brain metabolism as measured by the scans. First, the scientists taught it to predict men’s ages from metabolism data gleaned（收集） from the male brain scans.
The striking（明显的）result came when the scientists fed metabolism data from the women into the same program. While the program estimated male ages accurately, it judged the women’s brains to be, on average, 3.8 years younger than their real ages.
The scientists then flipped the analysis around. They trained the algorithm to predict women’s ages from data garnered from their brain scans. This time, when they fed metabolism data from the men into the computer, it estimated them to be 2.4 years older than they were. The way male brains burned sugar made them seem older than female ones of the same age.
“The great mystery is why,” said Raichle. The researchers suspect（怀疑） something other than hormonal differences are at work because the difference in metabolism stays the same when women enter the menopause.
“I refer to things like this as the curve balls of Mother Nature,” said Raichle. “Maybe women start off with this difference and it’s perpetuated throughout（贯穿） life.”
It is not clear what the difference means. The scientists are keen to（热衷于）investigate whether people with low glucose metabolism in particular parts of the brain are more prone（倾向于） to memory loss, learning problems and neurodegenerative diseases as they age.
“Is lower metabolism in such and such an area predictive of a particular event down the road? We don’t know,” said Raichle. “But if aerobic glycolysis is protective in some way, and the brain loses some element of it, that could be a problem.” Details of the study are reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Mani Goyal at the university’s Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology and first author on the paper, said men’s brains were not ageing faster than women’s. “They start adulthood about three years older than women and that persists throughout life,” he said. “What we don’t know is what it means. I think this could mean that the reason women don’t experience as much cognitive decline（认知下降） in later years（在晚年） is because their brains are effectively younger.”

Huawei launches first 5G digital indoor system in Shanghai railway station
华为于上海虹桥火车站启动5G室内数字系统建设
难度：六级/考研单词：477读后感：380来源：China Daily生词过滤：考研

Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station（火车站）became the first railway station built upon the 5G digital indoor system after China Mobile Shanghai and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd partnered to launch the network's deployment there on Monday.
The move aims to achieve deep indoor 5G coverage within the whole station by the end of 2019. It will deliver easy access to fast 5G network services for all passengers.
A 5G network in the railway station will be a key milestone(里程碑) in 5G commercial deployment across Shanghai. It will lay a solid(坚实的) foundation for building Shanghai as a dual-gigaband city, with gigabit network speeds on both mobile and fixed networks.
Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station is one of Asia's biggest traffic hubs in terms of passenger volume, and a showcase for China's railway system. It handles over 60 million passengers every year, with over 330,000 people passing through each day during peak（高峰） seasons.
As the 5G era approaches（到来）, one of the key concerns for telecom operators will be how they can use 5G networks to meet the needs of high-density areas with thousands of people are simultaneously（同时） using the network to make phone calls, access the internet, and make mobile payments.
It is well-known that 5G offers high bandwidth, low latency, and massive（大量的） connections. However, it uses high frequencies, which means that network signals will lose a lot when penetrating into（穿过） buildings. This makes it not easy to provide full 5G coverage（覆盖） in any indoor environment. In a huge building like Hongqiao Railway Station, with a large number of passengers generating vast data flows, the challenge is even tougher（艰巨）.
China Mobile Shanghai selected Huawei's 5G Digital Indoor System, which is currently the industry's only commercially-available solution（解决方案） for 5G indoor coverage. This product was developed in Shanghai, and is now ready for mass delivery. Huawei's 5G system is undoubtedly（无疑）the best choice for 5G commercial deployment of operators.
According to industry insiders, most 5G base stations（基站） are being deployed outdoors. Huawei's 5G system will ensure that 5G network coverage extends into every scenario（场景） in every corner of the city.
At the launch event, China Mobile Shanghai and Huawei demonstrated（演示） the 1.2Gbps peak rate enabled by Huawei's 5G system. This will mean that after logging on to the network supported by the system, passengers will be able to download a 2GB high-definitio（高清）film in less than 20 seconds. They will be able to enjoy a seamless entertainment experience as they wait, board and ride their train. And 5G will reshape（重塑） people's lives by creating interactive services, such as robot navigation（导航） and takeaway delivery.
Peter Zhou from Huawei Wireless Network Product Line said 5G also will provide a big boost to cloud services. The railway stations of the future may be more intelligent（智能的） than most can possibly imagine.

Facebook Voids Accounts Targeting Moldovan Election
难度：六级/考研单词：539读后感：15来源：VOA生词过滤：考研
FILE - An illustration（说明） shows a 3-D-printed Facebook logo placed on broken glass above a printed EU flag.
CHISINAU/BRUSSELS —
Facebook said on Thursday it had disrupted an attempt to influence voters in Moldova, increasing concerns that EU elections in May could be prey to malign activity.
Employees of the Moldovan government were linked to some of the activity, the California-based social media company said. Authorities in Chisnau, capital of the tiny former Soviet republic, denied knowledge.
Facebook said it dismantled scores of pages and accounts designed to look like independent opinion pages and to impersonate a local fact-checking organization ahead of Moldova's elections later this month.
"So they created this feedback（反馈，反应）loop," Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity（网络安全）policy, told reporters in Brussels. "We did assess that there were links between some of that activity and individuals associated with the Moldovan government."
The government said it welcomed any initiative to combat "fake news（假新闻）", saying it did not check the private accounts of its more than 200,000 state employees.
"They have different political views and opinions, and the state is obliged（有义务）to maintain the boundary（界限） between fighting the phenomenon（现象）of Fake News and guaranteeing（保证）the freedom of expression for citizens（公民的言论自由）," it said.
Facebook said it removed 168 accounts, 28 pages and eight Instagram accounts involved in "inauthentic behavior." Some 54,000 accounts followed at least one of these Facebook pages.
The owners of pages and accounts typically posted about local news and political issues such as requirements for Russian- or English-language education and potential（潜在的）reunification with Romania, the company said.
Guarding elections
Facebook stepped up efforts to combat disinformation, including accounts in Russia, Iran and Indonesia, over the last year after coming under public scrutiny for not doing enough to stem the spread extremism and propaganda（宣传） online.
The vulnerabilities（脆弱点）exposed in Moldova, sandwiched between EU member Romania and Ukraine on the fringes of the bloc, were a warning ahead of polls in neighboring Ukraine and for the European legislature.
The European Union has pushed tech companies to do more to stop what it fears are Russian attempts to undermine Western democracies with disinformation campaigns that sow division. Russia has repeatedly denied any such actions.
The sheer perception of manipulation can damage polls, Gleicher warned. "We are starting to see actors try to create the impression that there is manipulation without owning lots and lots of accounts," he said.
"We already have the teams up and running and focused on the European parliamentary elections and that is only going to grow as the elections get closer and the pace of threats increases."
Dogged by scandal, Moldova's pro-Western government has failed to lift low living standards. That has driven many voters towards the Socialists, who favor closer ties with Russia.
The European Parliament called Moldova a "state captured by oligarchic interests" in November, and there are concerns（关心） whether the parliamentary election on February 24 will be fair. The election is likely to produce a hung parliament, which could set the scene for months of wrangling or possibly further elections.

What happens when your bitcoin banker dies?
比特币大佬去世，1.47亿美元数字货币也随他而去
难度：六级/考研单词：579读后感：32来源：The Economist生词过滤：考研
Apparently you can take it with you after all

BITCOIN WAS introduced to the world in August 2008, in the aftermath(后果) of the financial crisis. According to its techno-libertarian fan-base, one of its main attractions was the promise that users could avoid dealing with（与...交易） the hated banks. But after a decade of amateurism, scams and billions of dollars of lost or stolen money, it is clear that many of the ramshackle institutions that play the role of banks in the cryptocurrency（数字货币）world make even their most reckless conventional counterparts look like paragons of good management.
The latest example is QuadrigaCX, a Canadian cryptocurrency exchange that was granted protection from its creditors on February 5th. The problem, according to the firm, is not that it has lost its customers’ money, but that it cannot get to it. It says that Gerald Cotten, its boss, died unexpectedly in India in December.
Few banks would be brought to ruin by the death of a single member of staff. But QuadrigaCX says that Mr Cotten was in sole charge of handling deposits（储蓄） and payouts（支出）, running everything from an encrypted laptop to which only he knew the password. In court documents Mr Cotten’s widow says that “despite repeated and diligent searches, I have not been able to find [the passwords] written down anywhere”. QuadrigaCX’s 90,000 customers cannot get to around C$180m ($136m) of bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and various other cryptocurrencies stored on the exchange. One is thought to have lost access to C$70m-worth of cryptocurrency.
Discussion（讨论）of QuadrigaCX online is a swamp of anger, amateur detective work and conspiracy theories. The firm seems to have been in trouble for a while; in January 2018 the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce froze C$28m held by Costodian, QuadrigaCX’s payment processor. The bank tried repeatedly to contact Mr Cotten, to no avail. There are other curiosities. A screenshot supposedly showing a death certificate issued by the government of Rajasthan misspells Mr Cotten’s name. Experts consulting bitcoin’s public transaction register have struggled to identify the inaccessible deposits. Jesse Powell, the boss of Kraken, another cryptocurrency exchange, said on Twitter that QuadrigaCX’s story was “bizarre and, frankly, unbelievable”.
This is not the first time that large amounts of cryptocurrency have been inadvertently removed from circulation. James Howells, a British cryptocurrency enthusiast, amassed 7,500 Bitcoins in 2009, when they were nearly worthless, before throwing away the hard drive on which they were stored. By 2013 they were worth millions of dollars. Mr Howells’s attempts to recover his hard drive from a Welsh landfill failed. Chainalysis, a firm of cryptocurrency-watchers, reckons access to 2.78m-3.79m bitcoins has been lost in similar circumstances. Since the way bitcoin is designed caps the number of coins at 21m, that is 13-18% of all bitcoins that will ever exist.
The cryptocurrency world has seen bigger collapses than QuadrigaCX’s. The biggest was MtGox, which was responsible for around 70% of all bitcoin transactions when it went bust in 2014 after the theft of 850,000 bitcoins, then worth $450m. Like QuadrigaCX, it had been run on a wing and a prayer. Some exchanges are better than others, says David Gerard, a cryptocurrency-watcher and sceptic. But too often storing cryptocurrency on an exchange is little better than “keeping your money in a sock under someone else’s bed.”

Seven ways to improve your breathing

Become aware of(注意) your breath 留意你的呼吸
Breathing(呼吸) is so instinctive（本能的）, you may have developed habits（养成习惯）you are not aware of. Start by monitoring your breathing for 48 hours, particularly（尤其）at moments when you are stressed or anxious（焦虑）. Are you struggling for air, mouth-breathing, breathing rapidly or irregularly（不规律地）or deeply or shallowly（浅的）?

呼吸是如此的自然，以至于你可能并能没有察觉到呼吸习惯的养成。从现在开始，关注你的呼吸48小时，尤其是，当你感觉到压力和焦虑时。你是否在努力呼吸，用嘴呼吸，呼吸加速或者不规律的呼吸又或者深呼吸或者浅呼吸。

Adopt good posture
Better posture（姿势）leads to better breathing, sometimes within just a few breaths. Correct postures means that the diaphragm（隔膜） – the muscle between the chest（胸部） and the abdomen（腹部）, which plays a key role in（起到关键的作用）moving air in and out – is not constricted. Ensure that your back is upright and your shoulders back and down. Your chin needs to be very slightly raised and your jaw, shoulders and neck relaxed.

正确的姿势可以更好的呼吸，有时..., 正确的姿势意味着起到关键作用的位于胸腔和腹腔的隔膜没有被压缩。

Know that a sigh(叹气) is not just a sigh
Excessive sighing and yawning; a feeling of not being able to get sufficient air, known as “air hunger”; or a sense of being “spaced out” may all point to overbreathing (hyperventilation). This can become habitual. Breathing retraining may help, but first see your doctor for a check-up.
Avoid deliberately（蓄意地） taking deep breaths（深呼吸）
That it’s healthy to breathe deeply is just a 20th century myth. When we are stressed or anxious, our breathing and heart rates increase（心跳加速）; breathing deeply（深呼吸）leads to getting less oxygen, not more, and may increase anxiety and panic. Taking slow, gentle（温柔的）, controlled breaths will be more effective in helping to calm you down if you are stressed（压力） or anxious（焦虑）.
Use your nose
Unless you are working or exercising vigorously, unblock your nose and get into the habit of（习惯于） nose breathing. It helps to filter pollutants（污染物）, allergens and toxins as we inhale（吸入）, and warms and humidifies the air. When we mouth-breathe（用嘴呼吸）, the volume of air is markedly increased, which can lead to a habit of overbreathing（过渡呼吸）and increase anxiety; it also dries out the mouth, and may lead to（导致）a variety of dental（牙齿的） issues（问题）.
Stop snoring
Snoring（打呼噜）can be associated with（与...有关）overbreathing, due to increased air volume, turbulence and vibration, and may lead to unrefreshing sleep, fatigue, waking with a dry mouth, sore（疼痛的）throat or headaches. To improve（改善）snoring, always sleep on your side and avoid（避免）eating a large meal or drinking alcohol（饮酒）close to bedtime（临近睡觉时间）.
De-stress
When you feel anxious, take time out to destress（解压） and calm down your breathing. Introduce some destressing activities into your life; a daily walk in a park or quiet area is great. When you are calm, you will find that your breathing is effortless, and this is the key to better breathing, refreshing sleep, improved mood（心情） and better health.

Chinese smartphone sales dive 10.5 % in 2018
2018年国内智能手机销量下滑10.5%
难度：四级单词：277读后感：257来源：Shine生词过滤：考研

Chinese smartphone sales dropped more than 10 percent year on year in 2018, due to economic pressures, longer replacement cycles and shrinking(收紧的) consumer budgets.
Top vendors in the domestic market were Huawei with 26.4 percent of the market, Oppo with 19.8 percent, Vivo with 19.1 percent, Xiaomi with 13.1 percent and Apple with 9.1 percent, according to the International Data Corp or IDC latest report.
In 2018, Chinese smartphone sales were 397.7 million units, 10.5 percent down from a year earlier, IDC said.
As one of the top five vendors in the Chinese market, Apple continued to decline as its expensive unit prices became increasingly out of line with the tough local market.
Last year also saw Huawei overtake Apple as the world's No. 2 smartphone company.
Xiaomi took a “significant fall” in the domestic market due to problems with its product range, and internal restructuring.
China is in a leading position globally for the roll-out of the next generation 5G mobile technology, but IDC stressed 5G will have only a small share of the market this year.
In the saturated（饱和的） domestic smartphone market, winning over existing users will be the most important task for smartphone vendors, analysts said.
“The Chinese smartphone market still looks far from optimistic in 2019,” said Xi Wang, IDC China Senior Market Analyst.
Xiaomi, which released its new Mi 9 on Wednesday in Beijing, has also emphasized its strategy focusing on artificial intelligence（人工智能）and smart homes.
This includes its Xiaoai speaker, an AI competitor to Amazon.com's Echo. Nine million Xiaoai units were sold globally last year.

Intel’s new boss leads a firm that is both thriving and troubled
新掌门能否带领英特尔走出尴尬局面
难度：六级/考研单词：686读后感：109来源：The Economist生词过滤：考研

AFTER A SEVEN-MONTH search, Intel on January 31st announced that its new chief executive would be its chief financial officer. Robert Swan had been filling in as the boss since last year, when Brian Krzanich, his predecessor, left after violating（违反） company rules about relationships with subordinates. Mr Swan inherits a company with dominant products and an enviable market position—but also one whose core business has stumbled.
The good news is that an increasingly electronic world has an insatiable appetite for the computer chips that Intel makes. A week before Mr Swan’s appointment Intel announced results that reflected strong growth. Its annual revenue, of $70.8bn, set a record, and its operating income of $23.3bn was up by 29% from the same period in 2017 (though the numbers were slightly below the market’s expectations).
Intel’s chips power 84% of desktop computers, leaving scraps for Advanced Micro Devices, its only competitor. It has a near 100% market share in the more profitable market for the beefier chips used in data-centres and cloud-computing farms.
On the face of it the future looks promising（有前途的）, too. The personal computer market is growing again after years of decline. As connected gizmos proliferate—everything from smart speakers to TVs, cars and medical devices—the market for server chips to process the information they collect should grow briskly as well.
Under Mr Krzanich, Intel had hoped to reinforce its cloud-computing dominance by expanding into new areas, particularly specialised “accelerator” chips designed to speed up specific data-centre workloads. It bought Altera, a maker of field-programmable gate arrays, or chips that can be programmed, in 2015, and Nervana, which makes machine-learning chips, a year later. The aim was to compete with firms like Nvidia, which already offers silicon customised for certain data-centre workloads, chiefly artificial intelligence. It acquired Mobileye, an Israeli maker of computer-vision chips for cars, in 2017.
Mr Swan’s most urgent job, though, is to ensure Intel’s misfiring core business can bring it into that future. One vital ingredient of its dominance has been its prowess in ultra-high-tech manufacturing, repeatedly shrinking the components in its chips as predicted by Moore’s Law, which was named for the firm’s co-founder. Each time those components shrank, the chips built from them got faster, cheaper and less power-hungry. Intel was better at doing that than any of its competitors, releasing improved chips with such metronomic regularity that its product-release schedule was given the name “tick-tock”.
But it has stumbled lately. Its newest “10-nanometre” factories were due to start producing chips in 2016 (the number refers, in a very loose sense, to how densely packed the components in a chip are). They will not now be ready until 2020, an unprecedented delay. That has allowed two rivals, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung, a South Korean firm, to catch up.
Things will only get harder. The cost of yet more component-shrinking is becoming prohibitive. State-of-the-art chip factories cost more than $10bn, a number that is rising. Many formerly cutting-edge firms have thrown in the towel over the past decade. Worse, the physics of how electronic components behave at near-atomic scales means that each new round of shrinkage offers fewer benefits than it used to. Intel spends heavily on R&D, exploring everything from better chip packaging to exotic ideas like quantum-mechanical transistors. But none is yet ready for prime time.
Some worry that Intel’s attempts at diversification risk misallocating both cash and its engineers’ attention. In any case, says Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley, a bank, Intel has always struggled outside its core business of desktop and server chips. In a post-appointment email to employees, Mr Swan said he was not minded to change the fundamentals of his predecessors’ strategy. But he did not mince his other words: “our execution must improve”.
